Migrate Google Keep and Dokuwiki to Joplin
Google Keep → Joplin (Greek UTF-8 Supported)

This guide explains how to migrate notes from Google Keep into Joplin.

Since the Google Keep plugin is not supported in Joplin Desktop, this method converts Google Keep notes into an Evernote (.enex) file, which can then be imported into Joplin.

Greek (UTF-8) characters are fully supported.

Requirements

Python 3.7 or newer

Python dependency:

pip install parsedatetime

Migration Steps
1. Export Google Keep data

Go to Google Takeout

Select Google Keep

Download the generated archive

2. Extract the archive

Extract the downloaded file

Navigate to the Keep folder

3. Convert Google Keep notes to Evernote format

Place the Python script in the Keep folder

Run the following command:

python3 keep-to-enex.py Keep/*.html -o output.enex


This will generate an Evernote (.enex) file.

4. Import into Joplin

Open Joplin

Go to File → Import → ENEX – Evernote Export File (as Markdown)

Select output.enex
